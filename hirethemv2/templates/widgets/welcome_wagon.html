  Welcome to your new Django site!
</h1>

<p>
  The site you've just spun up comes with a handful of useful default options
  that you are free to extend as though it were any other Django project.
</p>

<p>
  For starters, you can play around with the template for the page you're looking at right now,
  which is <code>hirethemv2/templates/homepage.html</code>.
</p>

  Templates
</h2>
<p>
  This project comes equipped with a basic template you can build on to create your static pages
  and other views, without needing to see another barebones "Hello World!" page.
</p>
<p>
  For starters, the page you're looking at is the static <code>homepage.html</code>,
  which you'll find in the project's root <code>templates</code> directory.
  It extends from <code>templates/base.html</code>, where the page layout is defined.
</p>
<p>
  <code>base.html</code> brings in static files for a local copy of
  <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bootstrap 5.1.3</a>, including its CSS and bundled JavaScript
  (the bundle includes <a href="https://popper.js.org/" target="_blank" rol="nofollow">popper.js</a>);
  <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">jQuery 3.4.1</a> loaded remotely; and
  a local copy of
  <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FontAwesome 5.15.4</a> free version
  (note that FontAwesome is loaded as a deferred <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in the site's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag,
  which loads SVG versions of the icons).
</p>
<p>
  We also load app-specific CSS and JavaScript, which you'll find at <code>static/css/app.css</code> and <code>static/js/app.js</code>.
  Some CSS is provided to enable to custom footer on this page, while the JavaScript is left empty for now.
</p>

<h3>
  <i class="fas fa-cog"></i>
  "Widget" templates
</h3>
<p>
  Some smaller templates are used on the site for the <strong>navbar</strong> and <strong>footer</strong>.
  You'll find them in the project root, at:
</p>

<pre class="bg-light p-3"><code>templates/widgets/base_navbar.html
templates/widgets/base_footer.html</code></pre>

<p>
  The only thing making them "widgets" is the fact that they separate some template functionality
  into separate files, which are then <code>{% templatetag openblock %} include {% templatetag closeblock %}</code>'ed
  in <code>base.html</code>. Not much more to it than that.
</p>
<p>
  The author mentions these only as a recommendation for
  further design within your own project, to help you
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DRY</a> up your code.
</p>

<h3>
  <i class="fas fa-clone"></i>
  Templating the templates
</h3>
<p>
  The file <code>templates/template_of_templates.html</code>
  (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/xzibit-yo-dawg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><em>yo dawg</em></a>)
  contains a breakdown for all <code>{% templatetag openblock %} block {% templatetag closeblock %}</code> tags
  used in <code>base.html</code>. When making new templates anywhere in the site,
  you can copy this file for a head start.
</p>
<p>
  Simply replace the contents of relevent blocks with your own
  and remove the blocks you don't need (but make sure the
  <code>{% templatetag openblock %} extends {% templatetag closeblock %}</code>
  tag is always the first line in the file, per Django requirements).
